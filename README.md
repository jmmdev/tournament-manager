Tournament Manager is a native mobile application crafted to assist tournament organizers on start.gg with their tasks. Recognizing the sluggishness and inefficiency of the mobile version of the website, I aimed to provide a more responsive and user-friendly alternative. While leveraging the official start.gg API helps mitigate some performance issues, complete eradication of delays may not be achievable. Currently in its early stages of development, the application boasts a valuable core feature: streamlined reporting of match results. Although the project is temporarily paused, it is available for testing. Please refer to the guide below for a quick overview.
